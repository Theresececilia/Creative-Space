        <h3>The Sun</h3>
        <p>The Sun card is about the self -- who you are and how you cultivate your personality and character.
          The Sun's radiance is where one's original nature can be encountered in health and safety. The limitations of
          time and space are stripped away;
          the soul is refreshed and temporarily protected from the chaos outside the garden walls. Under the light of
          the Sun, life reclaims its primordial goodness,
          truth, and beauty. If one person is shown on this card, it is usually signifying a human incarnation of the
          divine. When two humans are shown,
          the image is portraying a resolution of the tension between opposites at all levels.
          It's as if this card is saying "You can do no wrong -- it's all to the good!"

      <h3>The Star</h3>
      <p>The Star Tarot card is about reconnecting one's soul with the divine -- the transcending of personality,
        family, community, and reputation. It has to do ultimately with the freedom to be one's self. The soul is
        responding to celestial influences
        -- forces that can provide the personality with a stronger sense of purpose.
        The Star card helps us to remember our exalted origins and our attraction to a higher union.

      <h3>The Moon</h3>
      <p>The Moon card refers to a deep state of sensitivity and imaginative impressionability,
        developed within a womb of deep relaxation. Here we dream and go into trance, have visions and receive insights,
        wash in and out with the psychic tides, and experience deep mystical and/or terrifying realities beyond our
        ordinary senses.
        In a state of expanded consciousness, we cannot always control what happens. The Moon card represents the
        ultimate test of a soul's integrity,
        where the membrane between the self and the unknown is removed, and the drop of individuality re-enters the
        ocean of being.
        What transpires next is between a soul and its maker.

      <h3>The Death</h3>
      <p>This card is not about the literal death of any person.
        It may represent the death of something else, like a project, plan, or relationship. This card also points to a
        time of harvest.
        Unless the fruits of summer are harvested, they are lost to winter's harshness, and the people do not eat. As
        the scythe cuts the cords that link us to the past,
        it liberates us to go forward without fear, because we have nothing left to lose.

      <h3>The Justice</h3>
      <p>This card has to do with moral sensitivity and that which gives rise to empathy, compassion, and a sense of
        fairness.

      <h3>The Emperor</h3>
      <p>In the most practical terms, The Emperor card represents the highest leadership, a head of state, or the most
        exemplary and powerful person in the realm.
        This archetypal ruler is responsible for the affairs of a society or community,
        which are directly proportional to his well being and happiness.
