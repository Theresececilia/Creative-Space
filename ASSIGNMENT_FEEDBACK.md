This was waaaayy beyond what was required for the assignment and you did a fantastic job! 

The issue with doing so much is that there are more things that can go wrong and unfortunately I found one or two things. I sent you a message about them - I thought it was easier to explain the issues in a chat rather than static file.

It's extremely clear that you know what you are doing - but I would like to see that tarot page especially working as you intended it to. I have to grade you on what you are presenting, and if something doesn't work as intended it affects the project overall, even if it is outside the scope of the assignment.


Could you please fix the things I mentioned in the chat and let me know when I should have another look? As you can see below you have completed almost everything that is requiired for a VG grade.

CRITERIA FOR GRADING

*************************************

GODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

3 separate pages: ✅

A header with a page title on every page: ✅

A navigational menu every page with links to the other pages: ✅

Contact form:
    Email: ✅
    Message:✅
    Required:✅
    Mail to: ❌

RWD:
    Desktop: ✅
    Mobile: ✅
      The menu works as it is, gets a bit squished on mobiles. Other wise the repsonsiveness is well done for such a detailed site.

External CSS: ✅

-------------------------------------

VÄLGODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

Current page indication in the menu: ✅

Responsive Image: ✅
  Great use of images, way beyond what was required but extrememly well implemented. It looks great on all devices. Very well done

RWD:
  Media Query: ✅
    Check tablet portrait view. The menu items aren't centered and on AI-Music the labels for the tracks could use some attention. This is an FYI, not a requirement to fix.
  Flex/Grid: ✅

Separate CSS: ❌
  A better approach would be to have multiple and smaller css files - eg  general stylesheet for common elements such as the header, footer & menu, then one each for the individual pages as required. As an example if I wanted to change the labels for the tracks in AI-Music a css file names ai-music.css lets me know exactly where I should look. Cound you break out the common elements into their own files?
  Semantic: ✅

Semantic Element naming: ✅
  10/10 - generally ids are written as "the-sun" - but this shows a clear understanding of what you are doing.

Code Style:
  HTML: ✅
  CSS: ✅
